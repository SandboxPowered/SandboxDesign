# Design Proposal Template

 - Type : design proposal

 - Status : Draft
 - Discussion : [#1](https://github.com/SandboxPowered/SandboxDesign/issues/1)
 - Depends on : none (list of links to discussion issues for proposals this one depends on)

## Summary

We are lacking an open discussion process for Sandbox API.
This proposal is to be used as an example template to create further proposals for this process.

## Motivation

A lot of people show interest in the design of the Sandbox API, and often have interesting ideas and opinions.
To be able to discuss these design elements in a more effective manner, we need a unified way of structuring design
proposals.

This template would help make a proposal containing all the required information, as well as help find the
information in the proposal.

Being able to go back to discussions on old proposals helps to get the context of a decision for future decisions or
modifications to the original.

## Description

This template exists as a guide for other proposals to follow.
The main sections (h2) should be kept the same, but subsections can be added as seen fit to ensure a clear structure
for the proposal.

### New proposals

All new design proposals should be defined according to this template, on the latest version on the master
branch at the time of accepting (merging) the proposal.

### Old proposals

Existing (accepted) proposals do not need to be updated to the latest version of this template, but can (including when
we make changes to an existing proposal).

## Limitations

Sandbox Enhancement Process can evolve over time, so we expect to change this template over time.
