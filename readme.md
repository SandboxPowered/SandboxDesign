## How we make design decisions

Each proposal is linked to a discussion thread (GitHub issue), to make it easier to get the
context of a decision for future decisions or modifications of the original.

### New proposals

When we need to make a design decision on topics not covered by prior proposals, we first create a new issue to discuss it.
Once we start having a clearer idea of what needs to be done and someone steps up to contribute, they can open a pull request
with the actual proposal text (use the [template](/proposals/00_template.md) to start with).

The pull request should only be used for to discuss the format (vocabulary changes, syntax, ...) while actual design discussion
should still be in the issue.

### Existing proposals

When we need to make a design decision on topics already covered by prior proposals, discussion should be done in the original issue.
Once we start having a clearer idea of what needs to be done and someone steps up to contribute, they can open a pull request
with the changes to the proposal.

The pull request should only be used for to discuss the format (vocabulary changes, syntax, ...) while actual design discussion
should still be in the issue.
